<title>Report a problem with the image viewer</title>
<p>
 The <gui>image viewer</gui> is maintained by a volunteer community.  You are welcome to participate.
 </p>

<p>
   If you experience problems with the image viewer (for example, if it crashes or behaves unexpectedly), or if it is missing some feature that you think it should have, please file a <em>bug report</em>. To file a bug, go to <link href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/eog/issues/"/>.
   </p>
   <p>
   To participate you need an account which will give you the ability to gain access, file bugs, and make comments.  Also, you need to register so you can receive updates by e-mail about the status of your bug. If you don't already have an account, just click on the <gui>Sign in / Register</gui> link to create one.
   </p>
   <p>
   Once you have an account, log in, and click on <gui>New issue</gui>.
   Before reporting a bug, please read the <link href="https://bugzilla.gnome.org/page.cgi?id=bug-writing.html">bug writing guidelines</link>,  and please <link href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/eog/issues">browse</link> for the bug to see if it already exists.
   </p>
   <p>
   If you are requesting a new feature, choose <gui>1. Feature</gui> in the <gui>Labels</gui> menu.
   Fill in the Title and Description sections and click <gui>Submit Issue</gui>.
   </p>
   <p>
      Your report will be given an ID number, and its status will be updated as it is being dealt with. Bugs can take a while to be fixed, and the software developers might ask you for further information to help them figure out what the problem is.
