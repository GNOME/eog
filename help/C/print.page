<title>Print a picture</title>

<p>To print the picture that you are currently viewing:</p>

<steps>
 <item>
  <p>Click <gui style="menuitem">Print…</gui>.</p>
 </item>
 <item>
  <p>Under the <gui>General</gui> tab, choose the printer you want to use and 
  the number of copies you want to print.</p>
 </item>
 <item>
  <p>If you go to the <gui>Image Settings</gui> tab, you can
adjust the <gui>Position</gui> and <gui>Size</gui> of the picture.</p>
  <p>The position of the image on the page can also be adjusted by dragging 
  it around in the preview.</p>
 </item>
 <item>
  <p>If you are using high-quality photo paper, go to the <gui>Page Setup</gui> 
  tab and select the correct <gui>Paper Type</gui>. You should also go to the 
  <gui>Image Quality</gui> tab and choose a high quality setting, so that you 
  get the best possible photo quality.</p>
 </item>
 <item>
  <p>Click <gui>Print</gui>.</p>
 </item>
</steps>

<p>Note that some of the tabs mentioned above are not displayed for certain 
printer models. This is because the <em>printer drivers</em> for those 
printers don't allow some settings to be changed. So, for example, if you don't 
see an <gui>Image Quality</gui> tab, that probably means that the printer 
drivers that are being used don't support those settings.</p>
