Hacking on the Eye of Gnome
===========================

The code for Eye of Gnome was written with several goals in mind:

	- maintainable,
	- extensible,
	- correct,
	- documented.

If you want to work on EOG as well, please read the GNOME Programming
Guidelines first, understand their purpose, and keep them in mind when
writing code for EOG.

If you have a patch you would like to put into EOG, please propose a merge
request containing the patch using
https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/eog/merge_requests/new

This way your submisson won't get lost.
